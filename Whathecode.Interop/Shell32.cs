		/// <returns>Returns TRUE if successful; otherwise, FALSE. Call <see cref="Marshal.GetLastWin32Error" /> for extended error information.</returns>
		/// <remarks>
		///   Because <see cref="ShellExecuteEx "/> can delegate execution to Shell extensions (data sources, context menu handlers, verb implementations) that are activated using Component Object Model (COM),
		///   COM should be initialized before <see cref="ShellExecuteEx "/> is called.
		///   Some Shell extensions require the COM single-threaded apartment (STA) type. In that case, COM should be initialized as shown here:
		///   <code>CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED | COINIT_DISABLE_OLE1DDE)</code>
		///   There are instances where <see cref="ShellExecuteEx "/> does not use one of these types of Shell extension and those instances would not require COM to be initialized at all.
		///   Nonetheless, it is good practice to always initalize COM before using this function.
		/// 
		///   When DLLs are loaded into your process, you acquire a lock known as a loader lock.
		///   The DllMain function always executes under the loader lock.
		///   It is important that you do not call ShellExecuteEx while you hold a loader lock.
		///   Because <see cref="ShellExecuteEx "/> is extensible, you could load code that does not function properly in the presence of a loader lock, risking a deadlock and therefore an unresponsive thread.
		/// 
		///   With multiple monitors, if you specify an HWND and set the <see cref="ShellExecuteInfo.Verb" /> member of <see cref="executeInfo" /> to <see cref="CommonShellExecuteVerbs.Properties" />,
		///   any windows created by <see cref="ShellExecuteEx "/> might not appear in the correct position.
		/// 
		///   If the function succeeds, it sets the <see cref="ShellExecuteInfo.SitePointer" /> member of <see cref="executeInfo" /> structure to a value greater than 32.
		///   If the function fails, <see cref="ShellExecuteInfo.SitePointer" /> is set to the <see cref="ShellExecuteError" /> error value that best indicates the cause of the failure.
		///   Although <see cref="ShellExecuteInfo.SitePointer" /> is declared as an HINSTANCE for compatibility with 16-bit Windows applications, it is not a true HINSTANCE.
		///   It can be cast only to an int and can be compared only to either the value 32 or the <see cref="ShellExecuteError" /> error codes.
		/// 
		///   The <see cref="ShellExecuteError" /> error values are provided for compatibility with ShellExecute.
